## **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier from Scratch**

This repository contains a simple, object-oriented implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using only NumPy and standard Python libraries.
It supports multiple distance metrics:

- **Hamming distance**
- **Euclidean distance**
- **Manhattan distance**
